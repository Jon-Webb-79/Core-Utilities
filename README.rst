Core Utilities
**************

The Core Utilities program contains classes and functions that perform basic
operations necessary for most python programs such as reading and writing to files,
managing information,creating files and folders, and other basic operations.

This software package will continue to grow over time and will combine already
existing python functionality into one framework and in several occasions
will add to the basic capability.
